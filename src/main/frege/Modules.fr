module Modules where

-- selective import
import Recursion ()

-- alias for an import
import InputOutput as IOC

-- hiding functions from an imported module
import HighOrderFunctions hiding (composition1)

-- it only shows how to use hiding
composition1 :: [Int] -> Int

-- Because we used selective import
-- we need to be explicit using take' from
-- recursion module
